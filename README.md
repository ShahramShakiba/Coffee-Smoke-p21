> ## Overview
#### Welcome to the Coffee Smoke Project! ‚ú® <br/> 
ü™Ñ Imagine a cozy scene with a steaming cup of coffee, where gentle smoke rises and swirls in the air. <br/> <br/> This project lets you bring that serene moment to life with captivating smoke animations using vertex and fragment shaders by leveraging Perlin texture for improved performance. <br/> Whether you're a shader enthusiast or a curious beginner, this project offers a fun and rewarding way to boost your skills. üèÖ

### The Challenge
> Imagine this: 
  - You want to animate smoke rising from a coffee mug. It sounds simple, but it's a fantastic way to practice your shader skills! The table and mug are already modeled in Blender, so you're all set to focus on the smoke effect. üóØÔ∏è

### The Solution
üõ†Ô∏è To keep things smooth and efficient, especially for web performance, we employ custom shaders and Perlin texture to achieve a realistic smoke appearance while maintaining performance efficiency. <br/><br/>  The key steps include generating a Perlin noise texture, applying it to a particle system, and simulating the movement and diffusion of smoke particles. <br/> This technique is a favorite in video games to ensure optimal performance.

<br/>

### Key Considerations üåü
When choosing a noise texture, remember these three essential tips:
1. ***Enough Variations***: <br/> Ensure your texture has ample variations to avoid repetitive patterns and keep the smoke looking realistic.<br/> 

2. ***Big Enough (at least 128x128)***: <br/> Larger textures provide more detail, resulting in a smoother and more natural smoke effect.<br/>  

3. ***Seamless Tiling***: <br/> Your texture should tile seamlessly to avoid visible edges and ensure a continuous smoke flow.<br/> <br/> 

<br/> 

> ## Applications and Use Cases
#### _This smoke effect project has several applications across different industries_:

1. ***`Film and Animation`***: <br/> Enhancing visual storytelling by adding realistic smoke effects to scenes involving hot beverages or smoky environments.<br/><br/>
2. ***`Video Games`***: <br/> Creating immersive environments by simulating smoke from various sources such as mugs, chimneys, or campfires.<br/><br/>
3. ***`Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR)`***: <br/> Improving realism in virtual environments by integrating dynamic smoke effects.<br/><br/>
4. ***`Advertising and Marketing`***: <br/> Developing eye-catching visuals for commercials or product presentations involving hot drinks.<br/><br/>
5. ***`Web Development`***: <br/> Adding engaging visual effects to websites, especially for interactive storytelling or product showcases.<br/><br/>

By understanding and implementing this project, developers and artists can apply similar techniques to other particle-based effects, such as fog, fire, or magical particles.

<br/><br/> 

> ## Technical Details
The project involves the following components:

- **Three.js**: A JavaScript library used to create and display animated 3D computer graphics in a web browser.
- **Custom Shaders**: Shaders written in GLSL (OpenGL Shading Language) to control the rendering of smoke particles.
- **Perlin Texture**: A precomputed Perlin noise texture used for simulating the smoke effect efficiently, avoiding the performance overhead of calculating Perlin noise in real-time.

### Key Features
- **Particle System**: Generating particles at the mug's surface to represent smoke particles.
- **Smoke Simulation**: Applying transformations and movements to simulate the rising and dispersing behavior of smoke.
- **Performance Optimization**: Using Perlin texture to enhance performance by precomputing noise patterns.

### Technologies and Tools Used
- **Programming Language**: JavaScript
- **Graphics Library**: Three.js
- **Shader Language**: GLSL

<br/><br/>

> ## Similar Projects and Techniques

The techniques used in this project are applicable to various other visual effects and simulations, such as:

1. **`Fog and Mist`**: <br/> Simulating atmospheric effects for outdoor scenes in games or movies.
2. **`Fire and Explosions`**: <br/> Using particle systems and noise textures to create dynamic fire or explosion effects.
3. **`Magical Effects`**: <br/> Creating particle-based effects for magical spells or fantasy elements in games and animations.
4. **`Water and Liquid Simulations`**: <br/> Simulating splashes, waves, or other fluid behaviors using similar particle system techniques.

By adapting the principles of custom shaders and Perlin textures, we can create a wide range of visual effects with efficient performance.
